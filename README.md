# Shell-Edunet-AICTE-Internship
This project aims to build a garbage classification system using EfficientNetV2B2 to automate waste segregation, improve recycling, and support environmental conservation.

âœ… Week 1: Dataset Setup & Preprocessing
Acquired the Trash Type Image Dataset from Kaggle (2527 images across 6 classes).

Implemented data loading using image_dataset_from_directory, splitting it into training and validation sets.

Resized all images to 224x224, normalized pixel values, and applied cache() and prefetch() for faster loading.

Ensured environment compatibility and resolved path issues.

ðŸš€ Week 2: Model Optimization & Performance Boost
Increased input size to 260x260 to match EfficientNetV2B2 requirements.

Added preprocess_input() for accurate image normalization.

Optimized data pipelines across all datasets using cache(), shuffle(), and prefetch().

Introduced ModelCheckpoint, ReduceLROnPlateau, and EarlyStopping for efficient and stable training.

Enabled mixed_float16 for faster GPU training.

Optional upgrade to AdamW optimizer for better generalization.

ðŸ“ˆ Result: Improved accuracy, faster training, better generalization, and a robust pipeline ready for deployment.
