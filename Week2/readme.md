In this update, we optimized our garbage image classification model in several key areas:

Better Input Resolution:
We updated the image input size to 260x260 to match the default input resolution of EfficientNetV2B2. This helps the model retain more features and improves classification accuracy.

Efficient Preprocessing:
Introduced preprocess_input from the EfficientNet API to ensure images are normalized correctly before feeding into the model.

Faster Data Loading:
We enabled TensorFlowâ€™s cache() and prefetch() pipelines on all datasets. This reduces I/O bottlenecks and accelerates training.

Smart Training Control:

Implemented ModelCheckpoint to automatically save the best model.

Added ReduceLROnPlateau to decrease the learning rate if validation performance plateaus.

Mixed Precision Training:
Enabled mixed_float16 policy to utilize modern GPU acceleration, reducing training time significantly without loss in accuracy.

Output Precision Stability:
Forced the final output layer to use float32 to avoid issues from mixed precision when computing loss.

Optional Improvements (AdamW Optimizer):
Switched to AdamW, which offers better weight decay regularization and may reduce overfitting.

These improvements led to better generalization, faster training, and a more stable validation performance.
